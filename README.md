# Fontily: missing sketch plugin

Sketch plugin for finding & replacing fonts for Sketch 3+

## Replace fonts

Fontily will list all the fonts in document, and allow you to change selected ones. It tries to detect missing fonts, but Sketch API doesn't provide info whether this font is missing or not, so it may give false positives.


Shortcut: `cmd+g`
